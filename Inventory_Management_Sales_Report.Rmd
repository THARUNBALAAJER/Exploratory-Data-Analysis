## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document.
This Document contains all inventory and sales details wiht the analysis of sales by date and inventory by sale etc., By this HTML file we can understand the sales and inventory of product.

I'm maintaining the data of sales and Inventory by sales data in a daily manner.

```{r}
sales <- read_excel("C:/Users/Lenovo/Downloads/CIA_2_BODMAS_INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT_SALES.xlsx", sheet = "Sales")
Inventory <- read_excel("C:/Users/Lenovo/Downloads/CIA_2_BODMAS_INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT_SALES.xlsx", sheet = "Inventory")
Suppliers <- read_excel("C:/Users/Lenovo/Downloads/CIA_2_BODMAS_INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT_SALES.xlsx", sheet = "Suppliers")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
sales_summary <- sales %>%
  group_by(Product) %>%
  summarise(Total_Quantity = sum(Quantity),
            Total_Payment = sum(Payment))

ggplot(sales_summary, aes(x = Product, y = Total_Quantity, fill = Product)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Total Quantity Sold by Product", y = "Quantity Sold") +
  theme_minimal()
  #Bar plot - revenue 
ggplot(sales_summary, aes(x = Product, y = Total_Payment, fill = Product)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Total Revenue by Product", y = "Total Payment") +
  theme_minimal()

#creating a data included with date and manage data format
sales$Date <- as.Date(sales$Date, format="%d-%m-%Y")

#Calculating the daily sales value by the sale value and date
Daily_sales <- sales %>%
  group_by(Date) %>%
  summarise(Total_Sales = sum(Payment), Quantity_Sold = sum(Quantity))

ggplot(Daily_sales, aes(x = Date, y = Total_Sales)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Daily Sales Trend", y = "Sales Amount") +
  theme_minimal()

#understanding the columns placed there in inventory table to assign what to find and how to find 
colnames(Inventory)

# plotting the income of actual and budget values
ggplot(Inventory, aes(x = Product)) +
  geom_col(aes(y = `Total Income(Actual)`, fill = "Actual"), position = "dodge") +
  geom_col(aes(y = `Total Income(Budgeted)`, fill = "Budgeted"), position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Actual vs Budgeted Income by Product", y = "Income") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Actual" = "darkgreen", "Budgeted" = "orange")) +
  theme_minimal()

#assigning the value and creating as supplier's sales and merger them by product
supplier_sales <- merge(sales, Inventory, by = "Product")

#Summarizing the supplier data with sales and payemnt
supplier_summary <- supplier_sales %>%
  group_by(supplier_name) %>%
  summarise(Total_Sales = sum(Payment))

#plotting the supplier summary
ggplot(supplier_summary, aes(x = reorder(supplier_name, Total_Sales), y = Total_Sales, fill = supplier_name)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Total Sales by Supplier", y = "Sales Amount", x = "Supplier") +
  theme_minimal()


# Calculate sold percentage as Inventory data
Inventory_data <- Inventory %>%
  mutate(Sold_Percentage = (Sold / Total_product_Quantity) * 100)

#Plotting them with bar chart 
ggplot(Inventory_data, aes(x = Product, y = Sold_Percentage, fill = Product)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Sold Percentage by Product", y = "Sold %") +
  theme_minimal()

#Analyzing of top sales by the sale of product 
top_events <- sales %>%
  group_by(Description) %>%
  summarise(Total_Sold = sum(Quantity)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Total_Sold)) %>%
  head(10)

#Plotting them as top sales
ggplot(top_events, aes(x = reorder(Description, Total_Sold), y = Total_Sold, fill = Description)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Descriptions by Quantity Sold", x = "Description", y = "Quantity Sold") +
  theme_minimal()

# Mean Quantity and Payment by Gender
gender_summary <- sales %>%
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Quantity = mean(Quantity),
            Avg_Payment = mean(Payment),
            Total_Payment = sum(Payment))
print(gender_summary)

# Bar plot - Avg Quantity by Gender
ggplot(gender_summary, aes(x = Gender, y = Avg_Quantity, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Average Quantity Purchased by Gender", y = "Average Quantity") +
  theme_minimal()

# Bar plot - Avg Payment by Gender
ggplot(gender_summary, aes(x = Gender, y = Avg_Payment, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Average Payment by Gender", y = "Average Payment") +
  theme_minimal()

# Total quantity sold by product and gender
gender_product_summary <- sales %>%
  group_by(Gender, Product) %>%
  summarise(Total_Quantity = sum(Quantity)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Plot
ggplot(gender_product_summary, aes(x = Product, y = Total_Quantity, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Product Preference by Gender", y = "Total Quantity Sold") +
  theme_minimal()


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
